			<p>Eric has often struggled with living healthier due to working long hours. In addition, having an addiction to fast food. Despite this, he wishes to live a healthier lifestyle than the one he currently has. He has made small adjustments to his diet by eating more fruits and going to a fast food restaurant only for lunch instead of both lunch and dinner. Eric loves to track his progress on his health improvements by writing down his caloric intake and what kind of foods he eats but finds the process mundane and tedious. He wishes for a tool that can help him with making the process more enjoyable and rewarding.</p>

He tries pushing himself to do more but can’t find something to keep him motivated. He also wishes for an app that can help in tracking caloric intake and exercise amount better than his current app. While the one he uses does work, he complains about how missing a day can create data inconsistencies with diet tracking even when he usually ate like any other day. Matthew hopes he can find what he is looking for so he never has to worry about missing a day of logging due to forgetting or something urgent comes up.</p>

			<h2>User Testing</h2>
				
			<p>I performed user testing by asking my design peers for feedback on usability via an InVision prototype. Throughout the project, all wireframes (from lo-fidelity to final mockups) were tested and later updated based on the input provided from peers via Slack channels. Here's what happened:</p>

		<div class="challenge">

			<h3>Challenge #1 - Clearer Instructions for Switch Page</h3>
				
			<p>At the beginning of the user testing, my lo-fidelity prototype was created and sent to peers for testing. The main screen to be tested was the main innovation of the app itself: the Switch page.</p>

		<div class="challenge">
			
			<p>From the research gathered, <strong>most of the users found it confusing and frustrating on how the screen should work.</strong> As a result, changes were made to ease the use of using the screen. Such changes include simplifying the usability of the screen via the buttons in the middle; adding a drop-down menu for all items to include multiple options for replacement foods; and immediately updating the graph upon selecting a chosen food.</p>

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				
			<p>This project gave me significant insight into how marketing a product or service works. From innovative features to pricing; testimonials; and more. Such knowledge will serve me well in the future.</p>

			<h2 class="cs-hr">Lessons Learned</h2>

			<p><strong>It’s about the client’s clients, not me or the client.</strong> The customer is the one who’s going to interact with the product/service. By tailoring it to their needs and expectations, you’ll bring in more business. In testing, you’ll discover exciting trends and mindsets of users you never could’ve imagined (ex: What if I want to forecast foods with suggestions instead of a static list of healthy foods?). This feedback alone will make a better product.</p>

			<p><strong>You are going to jump back and forth quite a bit during project progression.</strong> I did a lot of hopping with managing the aspects of the project. From the user testing to the visual design, development, prototyping, etc. There is no formulaic way of conducting a UX project like this. Even so, it did grant me fulfillment. I was able to do something different almost every day which eliminated mundanity of the job.</p>

			<p><strong>Feedback is the key to building a better product.</strong>This is the truth to everything regarding projects. Feedback helped me find all kinds of errors, flaws, bugs, and glitches that I could not have seen by myself. Like a gem, a project must be polished until it gleams with purity. Only then will it show its real value to others.</p>
