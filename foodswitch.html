				<p>Eric has often struggled living healthier due to working long hours. In addition, having an addiction to fast food. Despite this, he wishes to live a healthier lifestyle than the one he currently has. He has made small adjustments to his diet by eating more fruits and going to a fast food restaurant only for lunch instead of both lunch and dinner. Eric loves to track his progress on his health impovements by writing down his caloric intake and what kind of foods he eats but finds the process mundane and tedious. He wishes for a tool that can help him with making the process more enjoyable and rewarding.</p>

				<h2 class="persona-hr">MOTIVATIONS</h2>
				<p>Matthew follows a popular diet known as the Paleo diet-a diet our ancestors, the Neanderthals, followed. While he enjoys his diet, he doesn’t get much exercise. He tries pushing himself to do more but can’t find something that can keep him motivated. He also wishes for an app that can help tracking caloric intake and exercise amount better than his current app. While the one he uses does work, he complains about how missing a day can create data inconsistencies with diet tracking even when he ate normally like any other day. Matthew hopes he can find what he is looking for so he never has to worry about missing a day of logging due to forgetting or something urgent comes up.</p>

				<p>I performed user testing by asking my design peers for feedback on usability via an InVision prototype. Throughout the project, all wireframes (from lo-fidelity to final mockups) were tested and later updated based on the feedback provided from peers via Slack channels.</p>

				<p>The lo-fidelity prototype was released and tested to show a rough idea of how users would sign up for FoodSwitch along with interacting with the dashboard and main innovation. Most users reported making the process less tedious and making the main innovation less confusing. Instructions had to be provided to help the user understand how the Switch worked when they should be able to pick it up right away just by looking at it.</p>

				<p>The final prototype had all of the fixes made based on feedback from users and peers. Positive feedback was given on the final prototype regarding the simplicity of going from one screen to another along with inputting calories and exercise. Users also were glad the Switch was easier to use and understand. It now uses radio buttons to select the alternative foods with a live updated line graph that changes every time a new alternative food item has been selected.</p>

				<p class="fs-p-conclusion">This project gave me big insight into how a product or service is marketed to potential users. From innovative features to pricing; testimonials; and more. Such knowledge will serve me well in the future.

				<h2 class="cs-hr">Lessons Learned</h2>

				<p><strong>It’s about the client’s clients, not me or the client.</strong> The customer is the one who’s going to interact with the product/service. By tailoring it to their needs and expectations, you’ll bring in more business. In testing, you’ll discover interesting trends and mindsets of users you never could’ve imagine (ex: What if I want to forecast foods with suggestions instead of a static list of healthy foods?). This feedback alone will make a better product.</p>

				<p><strong>You are going to jump back and forth quite a bit during project progression.</strong> A lot of hopping was done with managing the aspects of the project. From the user testing to the visual design, development, prototyping, etc. There is no formulaic way of conducting a UX project like this. Even so, it did grant me fulfillment. I was able to do something different almost every day which eliminated mundanity of the job.</p>

				<p><strong>Always remember you main innovation.</strong> It’s really easy to get lost in the weeds with trying to handle other main aspects of the project and forget what your project is all about regarding its main differentiator(s). That’s why it's imperative to go back and remeber the main objective frequently.</p>

				<p><strong>Feedback is the key to building a better product.</strong> This is the truth to everything regarding projects. Feedback helped me find all kinds of errors, flaws, bugs, and glitches that I could not have found by myself. Like a gem, a project must be polished until it gleams with purity. Only then will it show its true value to others.</p>
