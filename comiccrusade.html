			<h1>Competitive Analysis</h1>
					
			<p>My main competition was confirmed by my mass online survey. I discovered from the survey that 88.5% of respondents have used apps that involve comics (both buying and reading online) such as Amazon, DC, and Marvel. 57.7% of respondents found ease of use and reliability to be the best part of their apps of choice while 26.2% complained that navigation problems were the main issue. </p>

			<h1>Conclusion</h1>
				
			<p>I came out of this project with a real appreciation for Google's Material Design Systems as well as the overall process of crafting mobile designs for apps. The world of comics is a massive one. From Marvel to DC to even indie comics, a lot of people love a good visual story. ComicCrusade aimed to help unify comic book fans and those wanting to get into comics.

			<h2 class="cs-hr">Lessons Learned</h2>

			<p><strong>When in doubt, sketch!</strong> Sketching helped me immensely when confronted with creative block. It pays to write your ideas out so you can sort through them and make a decision easier. Multiple times I've had to go back and revise my wireframes using sketching. When one frame was just not working, I had to come up with a new look for it to work better.</p>

			<p><strong>It's better to have a finished "good enough" project than an unfinished "perfect" project.</strong> You can spend an eternity trying to make what you would consider a "prefect" project. You have to learn when to draw the line and say, "Enough is enough. If I keep this up, I'll never be finished." No design is perfect and you have to go with your gut when you would consider marking something as done.</p>

			<p><strong>Always remember your main innovation.</strong> It’s really easy to get lost in the weeds with trying to handle other main aspects of the project and forget what your project is all about regarding its main differentiator(s). That’s why it's imperative to go back and remeber the main objective frequently.</p>
