			<p class="persona-info">23-Year-Old Designer</p>

			<h3>MOTIVATIONS</h3>
			<p>Alice casually reads comics when she has free time from work. She normally buys comics at a store but has been buying them and other books online due to cheaper prices and always having them in stock. If the comic store near her workplace had what she wanted at a decent price, she would buy her physical copies there.</p>

			<p class="quote"><em>“I typically buy comics and other books online since buying them at a store can be costly and they sometimes don’t have what I’m looking for.”</em></p>

			<h3>GOALS</h3>
	 			<ul>
	 				<li>Buy comics at physical store if in stock and cheaper.</li>
	 				<li>Partake in comic-related events when possible.</li>
	 				<li>Connect with other people at comic store and at 
	 					comic-related events when possible.</li>

			<h3>FRUSTRATIONS</h3>
				<ul>
	 				<li>Stores don’t have what he wants in stock when visiting
	 				sometimes.</li>
	 				<li>Price of buying physical comics is higher than buying
					 and reading it online.</li>

			<p>Zachary enjoys going to his favorite comic book store just a few miles away from his school. He visits there weekly to see what’s hot on the shelves along with interacting with the staff he knows well. Despite the positive nature of the store, he gets frustrated when the new comics he wants aren’t in stock.</p>

		<div class="conclusion">

			<h2>Conclusion</h2>
				
			<p>I came out of this project with a real appreciation for Google's Material Design Systems as well as the overall process of crafting mobile designs for apps. The world of comics is a massive one. From Marvel to DC to even indie comics, a lot of people love a good visual story. ComicCrusade aimed to help unify comic book fans and those wanting to get into comics.

			<h2 class="cs-hr">Lessons Learned</h2>

			<p><strong>When in doubt, sketch!</strong> Sketching helped me immensely when confronted with creative block. It pays to write your ideas out so you can sort through them and make a decision easier. Multiple times I've had to go back and revise my wireframes using sketching. When one frame was just not working, I had to come up with a new look for it to work better.</p>

			<p><strong>It's better to have a finished "good enough" project than an unfinished "perfect" project.</strong> You can spend an eternity trying to make what you would consider a "prefect" project. You have to learn when to draw the line and say, "Enough is enough. If I keep this up, I'll never be finished." No design is perfect and you have to go with your gut when you would consider marking something as done.</p>

			<p><strong>Always remember your main innovation.</strong> It’s really easy to get lost in the weeds with trying to handle other main aspects of the project and forget what your project is all about regarding its main differentiator(s). That’s why it's imperative to go back and remeber the main objective frequently.</p>
