				<p>I sent a mass online survey to a subReddit forum; slack channels; and social media to better understand my target audience. From the research gathered, here's what was discovered: </p>

				<div class="store">

					<img src="images/store-visual-img.png" class="cc-research-img research-img">

					
					<p class="cc-ur-p"><strong>55%</strong> still go to comic book stores to purchase physical comics and merchandise.</p>

					<img src="images/comic-visual-img.png" class="cc-research-img research-img">
					
					<p class="cc-ur-p"><strong>56.3%</strong> want to continue experiencing the pleasure of owning a physical comic over a digital one.</p>

					<p class="cc-ur-p"><strong>43.7%</strong> want to engage in face-to-face interactions with the staff and other customers at the stores.</p>

				</div>
			
				
				<p>In addition to the mass survey sent, an in-person interview was conducted to better understand one of my later identified personas: the rusher. Valuable features were noted during the interview. Some examples include finding comics a store had in stock without the hassle of asking in person and the value of reading comics in person versus on an app.</p>

					<p>Personas were crafted based off of the results of the research conducted in this project. Both the survey results and the 1-on-1 interview I performed helped me identify my target groups:</p>

					<h1 class="test">Alice</h1>

					<p class="persona-bio persona-hr lead">23 Year-Old Designer</p>

					<h2 class="persona-hr">MOTIVATIONS</h2>
					<p>Alice casually reads comics when she has free time from work. She normally buys comics at a store but has been buying them and other books online due to cheaper prices and always having them in stock. If the comic store near her workplace had what she wanted at a decent price, she would buy her physical copies there.</p>

					<p class="quote"><em>“I typically buy comics and other books online since buying them at a store can be costly and they sometimes don’t have what I’m looking for.”</em></p>

					<h2 class="persona-hr">GOALS</h2>
	 				<ul>
	 					<li>Buy comics at physical store if in stock and cheaper.</li>
	 					<li>Partake in comic-related events when possible.</li>
	 					<li>Connect with other people at comic store and at 
	 					comic-related events when possible.</li>

					<h2 class="persona-hr">MOTIVATIONS</h2>
					<p>Zachary enjoys going to his favorite comic book store just a few miles away from his school. He visits there weekly to see what’s hot on the shelves along with interacting with the staff he knows well. Despite the positive nature of the store, he gets frustrated when the new comics he wants aren’t in stock.</p>

					<p class="quote"><em>“I’ve been reading comics ever since I was in my teens. I want to keep collecting and reading my favorite comics with the good people I interact with.”</em></p>

	 					<li>Continue buying comics in phsycial format at his store.</li>
